Depending on the jurisdiction, other things like fences, landscaping, septic tanks, and various potential hazards or nuisances might be regulated and prohibited by setback lines. Setbacks along state, provincial, or federal highways may also be set in the laws of the state or province, or the federal government. Local governments create setbacks through ordinances, zoning restrictions, and Building Codes, usually for reasons of public policy such as safety, privacy, and environmental protection. Neighborhood developers may create setback lines (usually defined in Covenants & Restrictions, and set forth in official neighborhood maps) to ensure uniform appearance in the neighborhood and prevent houses from crowding adjacent structures or streets.","http://content.aucklanddesignmanual.co.nz/ADM%20Images/Carousel/003_Apartments/003-06%20Building/003-06-2%20Building%20Form/003-06-2-3%20Building%20Setbacks/Bldg%20Setback%202/6.2.3%20(c)1.jpg"));

In Bangalore, 40 feet streets allow only an FAR of 1.75 but 100 feet streets allow 3.25 FAR.\n","https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQYimHsWVY8PRKEvKXOXfkGNsM90KginION09Q4cxEASusjgj0nBQ"));
