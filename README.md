So always pass current context to the Glide in Activity or Fragment using :
Glide.with(this)

5. Use RequestManager object in RecyclerView
We generally tend to use the sample code given in tutorials or docs as it is as long as its working its fine for us. With Glide this could lead to using 
it in Recycler view onBindViewHolder method like this :

Glide.with(context).load(...) 

Rather than doing this we can simply pass RequestManager object in Adapter’s constructor method and use it in a onBindViewHolder like :


private RequestManager glide;

public WalletsAdapter(RequestManager glide, List<MediaModel> modelList)
    {
    this.glide = glide;
    this.modelList = modelList;
}

@Override
public void onBindViewHolder(final WalletViewHolder holder, int position) {

    glide.load(getModel(position).url).into(holder.iconImages);
  
}
And adapter constructor would look like :


WalletsAdapter adpater = new WalletsAdapter(Glide.with(this), modelList);
